Statistical Hypothesis Testing is a method of statistical inference  used to decide whether the data at hand sufficiently supports a particular hypothesis. **Hypothesis Testing allows us to make probabilistic statements about population parameters**.

- Determine whether a predictor variable has a statistically significant relationship with an outcome variable
- estimate difference between two or more groups

Statistical Hypothesis assume a [[null hypothesis]] of no relationship or no difference between groups. Then they determine whether the observed data fall outside of the range of values predicted by the null hypothesis.
