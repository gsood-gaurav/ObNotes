We focus on a subset of the second type discussed above, specifically where (1) machine learning is used to (2) make predictions about some future outcome (3) pertaining to individuals, and those
predictions are used to make decisions about them.

We coin the term “predictive optimization” to refer to this form of algorithmic decision-making,1 because the decision-making rules at issue have been explicitly optimized with the narrow goal of maximizing the accuracy with which they predict some future outcome

This contrasts with manual approaches to developing decision-making rules that may involve a more deliberative process incorporating a range of considerations and goals.

How should one assemble the necessary data to make accurate and reliable predictions, ensure equally accurate predictions across the population, and achieve acceptable levels of accuracy given fundamental limits to prediction? And of course there are concerns around transparency and accountability: machine-learned models can be far more complex than those crafted by hand, defying meaningful inspection, and can be presented as anobjective basis upon which to make decisions, concealing the many ways in which human judgment entered the process of developing them.

The bedrock assumption of predictive optimization is that optimal predictions lead to optimal
decisions—or at least good decisions. However, since the algorithms are created using observational
data, they do not directly optimize the impact of the resulting interventions
