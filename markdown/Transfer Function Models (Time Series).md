[[Time Series]] data often involve simultaneous observation on several variables. In business one often tries to promote sales by advertising. It seems natural to build a dynamic model to relate current sales to present and past values of advertising to study the effect of advertising and to improve sales forecasting. We present transfer function models useful for relating an output series to one or more input series.
In analyzing multivariate time series the fundamental tool used in time domain approach is the [[cross-correlation function (CCF)]] and fundamental tool used in the frequency domain approach is the [[cross-spectral function]]. They also form a Fourier transform pair in time series analysis. The other useful method to analyze the relationship between variables is regression analysis. The use of time series variables in regression analysis including models with autocorrelated errors and various autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (ARCH) models for heterogeneous variances.
