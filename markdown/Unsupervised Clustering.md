In contrast to supervised method's dominant use of [backpropagation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation "Backpropagation"), unsupervised learning also employs other methods including: Hopfield learning rule, Boltzmann learning rule, Contrastive Divergence, Wake Sleep, Variational Inference, Maximum Likelihood, Maximum A Posteriori, Gibbs Sampling, and backpropagating reconstruction errors or hidden state reparameterizations

A central application of unsupervised clustering is in the field of [[density estimation]] in satistics, though unsupervised learning encompasses many other domains involving summarizing  and explaining data features. It can be contrasted with supervised learning by saying that whereas supervised learning intends to infer a [conditional probability distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_probability_distribution "Conditional probability distribution") conditioned on the label of input data; unsupervised learning intends to infer an [a priori probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_priori_probability "A priori probability") distribution.
