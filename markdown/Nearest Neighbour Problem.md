We explore effect of dimensionality on the "nearest neighbor problem" We show that under broad set of condtions (much broader than independent and identically distributed dimensions) as dimensionality increases, the distance to nearest data point approaches the distance to farthest data point. To provide a practical persepective, we present empirical results on both real and synthetic data sets that demonstrate that this effect can occur for as few as 10-15 dimensions.

These results should not be interpreted to mean that high dimensional indexing is never useful. We illustrate this point by identifying some high dimensional workloads for which this effect doesnt occur.

## Nearest Neighbour Problem
> 	Given a collection of data points and a query point in an m-dimensional metric space, find the data point that is closest to the query point.
