The book is based on an important principle.
**It is important to understand what you can do before you learn to measure how well you seem to have done it**

EDA regards whatever appearences we have recognized as partial descriptions and tries to look beneath them for new insights. Its concern is with appearence, not with confirmation.
Analyst of data needs tools and understanding.

The greatest value of picture is when it forces us to see what we never expected to see.

## Confirmatory Data Analysis (CDA)
The principles and procedures of CDA look at a sample and what sample has told us about the population from which it came and asses the precision with which our infrence from sample to population is made. We can no longer get without CDA but we need not start with it.

The best way to understand what CAN be done is no longer -- if it ever was -- to ask what things could, in the current state of our skill techniques be confirmed. Even more understanding is lost if we consider each thing we can do to data only in terms of some set of very restrictive assumptions under which that thing is best possible--assumptions we cannot check in practice.
## Exploration and Confirmation
Exploration and Confirmation should go side by side
# Chapter 1
We need both Tools and Understanding

Different detalied understanding are needed if we are to be highly effective in dealing with data concerning earthquakes, data concerning techniques of chemical manufacturing, data concerning size and profit of firms.
But, **In data analysis there are similar general understandings**

**The processes of criminal justice are clearly divided between the search for the evidence--in Anglo-Saxon lands the resposibility of the police and other investigative forces--and the evaluation of the evidence's strength--a matter for juries and judges. In data analysis a similar distinction is helpful. Exploratory data analysis is detective in character. Confirmatory data analysis is judicial or quasi-judicial in character**

Unless exploratory data analysis uncovers indications, usualy quantiative ones, there is likely to be nothing for confirmatory analysis to consider.
