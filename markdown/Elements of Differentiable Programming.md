Differentiable Programming is an emerging programming paradigm which enables end-to-end differentiation of complex computer programs (including those with control flows and data structures) making gradient based optimization of program parameters possible.

> [!note] Differentiable programming builds on several areas like autodiff, graphical models, optimzation and statistics.

Differentiable programming is not only differentiation of programs but thoughtful design of programs intended to be differentiated.

>[!note] By making programs differentiable we inherently introduce probability distributions over their execution, providing a means to quantify uncertainity associated with program outputs

Differentiable programming is useful beyond deep learning, e.g Reinforcement learning, probabilistic programming, scientific computing
