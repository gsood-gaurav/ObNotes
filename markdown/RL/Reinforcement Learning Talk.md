- Generative Models are data driven, learns about the world from the data, doesnt try to do better than the data?
- RL is all about opimization, optimizes a goal with emergent behavior, doesn't make use of real world data.
- Data without optimization doesn't allow us to solve new problems in new ways
- Optimization without data is hard to apply to the real world outside of simulators.

## What can we accomplish if we combine data and optimization

- Data Driven RL algorithms
- Robotic Foundation models  and RL
- RL with generative models
- offline RL and language models
