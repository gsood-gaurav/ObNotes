Percision = $\frac {TP} {TP + FP}$ 
Recall = $\frac {TP}{TP+FN}$ 

In medical application we want to reduce False Negatives as we don't want a patient which is positive to be negative. False Negatives are costlier than false positives. Therefor Recall is important.

In criminal justice, we dont want a innocent person (negative class) to be classified as criminal (positive class). We dont want False positives. Therefore Precision is more important.
