In many field of applications, the transfer function and regression models may not be appropiate because complicated feedforward and feedback relationships may exist among variables. For example although advertising is expected to promote sales, sales may also affect advertising because advertising budgets often set as a percentage of sales. We extend results to mutltivariate vector time series and study the joint relationship of several time variables. Vector autoregressive moving average models are introduced.
