The test statistic is a quantity derived from sample and used in [[Statistical Hypothesis Testing]]. It shows how closely your observed data match the distribution expected under the [[null hypothesis]] of that statistical test.

The [[Test Statistic]] is used to calculate p-value of your results, helping to decide whether to reject [[null hypothesis]].

## What exactly is Test Statistic
A test statistic describes how closely the distribution of your data matches the distribution predicted under the null hypothesis of the statistical test you are using. The distriution of the data is how often each observation occurs, and can be described by its [[central tendency]] and variation around that [[central tendency]].  **Different statistical tests predict different types of distributions, so it important to choose right statistical test for your hypothesis**.

The test statistic summarizes your observed data into a single number using the central tendency, variation, sample size and number of predictor variable in your statistical model.

Generally a test statistic is calculated as the pattern in your data (correlation between variables or difference between groups) divided by the variance in the data.
