Basic rules of proability remains same in both the cases

## Frquentist Approach
- Probabilities represent long running frequencies of events that can multiple times.
- For example if we flip coin, we expect it to land heads about half a time.
- 
## Bayesian Approach
- Probability is used to quantify our uncertainity or ignorance about something
- Fundamentally it is related to information rather than trials.

## Types of Uncertainity
- **Epistemtic or Model Uncertainity** due to our ignorance of the underlying hidden causes or the way we understand world or mechanism generating data
- **Aleatoric or Data Uncertainty** Intrinsic variability which cannot be reduced if we collect more data.
