Dimensionality Reduction Algorithms tend to fall into two catagories; those that seek to preserve the pairwise distance structure amongst all the data samples and those that favor the preservation of local distances over global distance.

Algorithms such as 
- PCA
- MDS
- Sammon mapping

fall into former category while
- t-SNE
- Isomap
- LargeVis
- Laplacian eigenmaps
- diffusion maps
- all fall into the latter category.
