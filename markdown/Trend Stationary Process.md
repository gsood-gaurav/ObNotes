A trend stationary process is a stochastic process from which underlying trend(function solely of time)  can be removed, leaving a stationary prcess. The trend doesnot have to be linear.

Conversely, if the process requires differencing to be made stationary, then it is called difference stationary and possessess one or more unit roots. 

**It is possible for a time series to be non-stationary yet have no unit root and be trend-stationary**

In both unit root and trend-stationary processes, the mean can be growing or decreasing over time; however in the presence of shock, trend -stationary processes are mean-reverting (time series will converge again towards growing mean which was not affected by shock) while unit-root processes have a permanent impact on the mean.
