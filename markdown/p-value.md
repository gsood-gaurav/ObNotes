The p-value is used in the context of null hypothesis testing in order to quantify the [[statistical significance]] of the result, the result being observed value of the chosen statistic $T$. **The lower the p-value lower the probability of getting that result if the null hypothesis were true**. A result is said to be statistically significant if it allows us to reject the null hypothesis. All other things being equal, smaller p-values are taken as stronger evidence against the null-hypothesis.
