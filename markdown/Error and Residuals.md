In [[Statisitics]] and Optimization *errors* and *residuals* are two closely related and easily confused measures of the deviation of an observed value of an elementof a statistical sample from its true value (not necessarily observable). The error of an observation is the deviation of the observed value from the true value of quantity of interest(e.g. popluation mean). The residual is difference between the observed value and the estimated value of the quantity of interest (e.g. sample mean)
