- Inductive Bias is a set of assumptions that the learner uses to predict outputs of given inputs that it has not encountered.
- Inductive Bias is anything which makes the algorithm learn one pattern instead of another pattern (step functions in decision trees instead of continuous functions in a linear regression model)
- Learning is process of apprehending useful knowledge by observing and/or interacting with the world. It involves searching a space of solutions for one expected to provide a better explanation of the data or to achieve higher rewards.
