## Continuous Random Variables
Define the events $A = (X \le a)$, $B = (X \le b)$ and $C = (a \lt X \le b )$  where $\mathcal{a} \lt b$ we have $B = A \cup C$  and since A and C are mutually exclusive the sum rule gives
$$Pr(B) = Pr(A) + Pr(C)$$ and hence the probability of being in interval $C$ is given by 
$$Pr(C) = Pr(B) - Pr(A)$$ In general we define the cumulative distribution function or cdf of radom variable $X$ as follows
$$P(x)\;{\buildrel\triangle\over=} \; Pr(X \le x)$$
