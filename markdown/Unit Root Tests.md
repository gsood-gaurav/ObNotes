# Introduction
Two common trend removal or detrending procedures
- First differencing: appropiate for $I(1)$ time series 
- time-trend regression: appropiate for $I(0)$ time series.

Unit root tests can be used to determine if trending data should be first differenced or regressed on deterministic functions of time to render data stationary.
