A prediction interval is associated with a random variable yet to be observed, with a specified probability of the random variable lying within the interval.  For example, I might give an 80% interval for the forecast of GDP in 2014. The actual GDP in 2014 should lie within the interval with probability 0.8. Prediction intervals can arise in Bayesian or Frequentist statistics.

A confidence interval is associated with a parameter and it is Frequentist concept. The parameter is assumed to be non-random and unknown and confidence interval is computed from data.  Because data are random, interval is random. A 95% confidence interval will contain the true parameter with probability 0.95. That is, with a large number of repeated samples, 95% of the intervals would contain true parameters

A Bayesian confidence interval also known as credible interval is an interval associated with the posterior distribution of the parameter. In the Bayesian perspective, parameters are treated as random variables and so have probability distributions. Thus a Bayesian confidence interval is like a prediction interval but associated with a parameter rather than observation.
