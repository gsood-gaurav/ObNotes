The [[Time Series]] approach which uses [[AutoCorrelation]] and [[partial autocorrelation]] functions to study the evolution of a time series through parametric models is known as time domain analysis. An alternative approach, which uses spectral frequency  components, is known as [[frequency domain analysis]]. Although these two approach are mathematically equivalent in the sense that the autocorrelation function and specturm function form a Fourier transform pair, on occasion one approach is more advantageous than the other.
